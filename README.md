# Stanford Policing Project

## Project Description
This project is based on data that was obtained from the Stanford Open Policing Project. Their webiste can be found [here](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/). In a nutshell, this data contains data pertaining to traffic stops from cities all around the United States. It contains data about the person pulled over, or "subject", such as their age, race, gender, etc. and various pieces of data on why a cop pulled them over and the circumstances and which they did. I decided to use their data for Raleigh, NC as that is the city I go to school in. The data set specific to Raleigh had 29 variables and a little over 800,000 rows of data.
